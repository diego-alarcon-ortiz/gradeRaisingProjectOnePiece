I'm so glad about this project being completed, I spend one entire week of work to do it as I wanted.

Our teacher sent us a personal project about a MOBILE game, and depending on how good it was, we could get a grade raise from 0,1 to 1,0 points

I did my best to do the game, following the rules that the teacher wrote in the subject, it had to be a cliker/tycoon game with materials and constructions

I love One Piece, the japanese manga about pirates, so I decided to give my project a brushstroke of a personal passion so I could enjoy it more than ever.

⚠️⚠️⚠️ IT IS A MOBILE APP, IT WAS NEVER THOUGHT TO BE PLAYED IN A COMPUTER SO THE INTERFACE MAY BE STRANGE IF U DON'T PUT MOBILE IN THE TOGGLE DEVICE BAR ⚠️⚠️⚠️
